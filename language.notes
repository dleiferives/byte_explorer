I want to implement a simple scripting language for this. to make dumps easier 
// first letter of each command must be unique.

f s // sets the file to s
o // opens the file 
r # // reads # bytes
ph # // prints n bytes in hex from cursor
phl # # // prints n bytes in groups of # lenght from cursor
pa // prints at cursor in raw ascii
c # //sets the cursor to #

w s // writes s to the screen till newline or '\0'
