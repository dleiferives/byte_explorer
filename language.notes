I want to implement a simple scripting language for this. to make dumps easier 

r # // reads # bytes
ph # // prints n bytes in hex
ph # # // prints n bytes in groups of # lenght
pa # // prints at # in raw ascii
pa # # // prints at # in raw ascii, till #

write s // writes s to the screen
writel s // writes s to screen with newline
